## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Fixed daily scheduling with independent day and night wallpapers and
  configurable 15-minute boundaries.
- Local-time overnight handling and catch-up after sleep or shell restart.
- Daily-mode manual overrides that remain active until the next boundary.
- Unit coverage for fixed daily schedule normalization, boundaries, overnight
  periods, and next-switch labels.

### Changed

- The schedule panel now switches between interval rotation and daily times
  without changing existing interval configurations.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Wallpaper preview grid for the active theme, with click-to-apply and a
  highlighted border on the current wallpaper.
- Automatic wallpaper cycling on a schedule: sequential advance or shuffle
  (play every wallpaper once before repeating).
- Interval options from 5 minutes to 24 hours.
- Theme-name detection that resets the rotation when the active theme changes.
- Persistent configuration under `~/.config/omarchy/auto-wallpaper/`.
- Omarchy bar widget with a "next wallpaper" tooltip and a middle-click to
  apply the next wallpaper now.
- Shell IPC commands for status, enable, disable, and immediate application.
- Pure scheduling logic with unit tests and a wallpaper catalog test in CI.

### Changed

- Rebranded from the upstream `acrogenesis.theme-scheduler` plugin as
  `dizziee.auto-wallpaper`, focused on wallpaper rotation instead of light/dark
  theme switching.
